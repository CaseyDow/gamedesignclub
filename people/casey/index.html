    <h4 style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I got into coding right as the pandemic began, back in May of 2020. At that point, I taught myself python, and later over the summer, took an online course to learn JavaScript. Then, at the beginning of my sophomore year, I began to set up my first website. This came along with the formation of the Game Design Club, and I used this website to build our first club game, TAPP.
    </h4><h4 style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The club initally started with just a few people, but we meet weekly and eventually finished TAPP, while I finished coding the online version. Although this may have been the first club game, Calvin and I were working with a group of friends back in 2017 to develop NVWK. This initally came about as we got bored of playing the same games over and over, so we decided to make our own.
    </h4><h4 style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In addition to developing board and card games, I taught myself Java to code mini-games in Minecraft. I've been playing Minecraft for many years, but most recently have been playing a lot on Hypixel, a mini-game based server, which inspired the development of my own server of mini-games for friends.
    </h4><h4 style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If anyone has any questions, contact me and I would be happy to help. Additionally, I can set up a page for anyone who wants to be added. I hope to see you guys in the club!
