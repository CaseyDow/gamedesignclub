    <h4 style="text-align: center">NVWK is a game where every card has its own rule. These rules dictate how it can be played and what it does. Every player is dealt a hand and the goal is to end the game with the least amount of points. In turns, players play sets of cards with various abilities to make opponents draw, steal the lead, or get rid of even more cards!</h4>

    <h1>NVWK: A History</h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNVWK was originally developed between a group of friends in 2017. At this point, we had been playing President for around a year, and had gotten pretty bored. Because of this, Casey brought the beginning of a new idea to the group. It consisted of the draw deck and play deck, and two abilities, the two and ace. It was based off of President, so turns were taken in order by playing sets of cards, but card drawing was added through both of the current pattern systems.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the following few months, every card was given an ability, the points system was developed, and evolving was added. The game was fairly finalized by now, and it would go on without much change until 2021. During this time, Casey began developing a deck of cards and a rulebook which could be used to teach the game. As seen above, the first two versions attempted to put the suit in the middle of the card, but this left very little room for the ability, and these designs were never fully developed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the pandemic began to come to an end and we came back in person in 2021, we began playing the game again at lunch. As it was played, further modifications were made, first changing sevens, then threes, and finally kings. The game reached another stable state, and two new card decks were developed, along with a new rulebook. As this state felt finished, Casey used the card designs to print a custom card deck, finalizing the game at the end of October 2021.
